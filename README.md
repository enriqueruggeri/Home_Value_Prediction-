## Home Values Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques

(Para la versión en español, consulte README_Spanish.md)


### Project Description.
This project focuses on predicting house prices using Machine Learning techniques. It uses data that includes information about house features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, neighborhood quality, among others.
### Objective
To build a model that can predict the value of houses with high accuracy, providing a useful tool for property valuation in the real estate market.

### Project Stages
1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the structure and distribution of the dataset variables.
2.	Data Preprocessing: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets; standardize the features.
3.	Model Training: Implement a linear regression model to predict house prices.
4.	Model Evaluation: Evaluate performance using metrics such as MSE and R².

### Technological Tools Used:
  - Python: Main programming language.
  - Pandas, NumPy: Data analysis and manipulation.
  - Scikit-Learn: Training and evaluation of the Machine Learning model.
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization.

### Conclusions
The implemented linear regression model achieved high accuracy in predicting house prices. Although a near-perfect fit was obtained in the test data, it is important to consider additional techniques to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization.
